Growth Prospects:
 Sanjay will take you all through the industry view, our business performance and also give a 
strategic outlook for the future growth of the company at the end.
After the successful acquisition of Exotech and the robust performance we delivered there in the 
last two years, we have gained more confidence in our execution capabilities of acquiring and 
integrating companies that could take SJS to the next level of growth.
With Walter Pack acquisition, we have not only acquired a very large growth and high margin 
business at a good valuation, but at the same time achieved many key strategic objectives in 
terms of addition of new and emerging technologies, new customers, manufacturing capabilities 
and increase management bandwidth.
Walter Pack Q1 witnessed a strong 
revenue growth of 21% YoY and a robust margin performance with EBITDA margins around 
31.5%.
Consolidated revenues, that is SJS plus Exotech 
together grew by 13.6% YoY on the back of strong 18.6% YoY growth in the automotive segment 
for us, that is the two wheeler and passenger vehicles combined. 

Business Changes:
 Sanjay will take you all through the industry view, our business performance and also give a 
strategic outlook for the future growth of the company at the end.
With Walter Pack acquisition, we have not only acquired a very large growth and high margin 
business at a good valuation, but at the same time achieved many key strategic objectives in 
terms of addition of new and emerging technologies, new customers, manufacturing capabilities 
and increase management bandwidth.
We also extended coverage of our Swachh Bharat initiative of garbage cleanup to 5 more 
surrounding villages, taking the total count to 12 villages.
Amit Hiranandani: 
One last question from my side on the standalone side, so SJS I understand is trying to acquire 
some strategic customers which will of course benefit in the mid to long term.
And secondly, are we going 
to see some impact on the margins due to the strategic step and sustainability of the margin if 
you can tell us on the annual basis for SJS standalone please? 

Triggers:
 Our organic and inorganic strategies have helped us make SJS a significant player in the 
automotive interior space.
